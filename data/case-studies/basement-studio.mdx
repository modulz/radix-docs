# Basement Studio

<HeroQuote>
  Radix has helped us with faster development, and better quality of the end
  product. It was super easy to get started – the configuration and defaults are
  great.

**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We’ve used it for [Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/dashboard) design system, but we mainly use it for websites – [Akash](https://akash.network), [Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com), and others coming up. 1-2 devs per project.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Radix has helped us with faster development, and better quality of the end product. The components that Radix provides are super hard to build. My DX has improved a lot with Radix – I use it as much as I can – Dropdowns, Tooltip, Tabs, Aspect Ratio, etc.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

I love Radix APIs. It was super easy to get started – the configuration and defaults are great. I have nothing to complain/improve off the top of my head.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The docs are amazing. One of the best docs I’ve ever used. Versioned, well explained, demos, and CodeSandboxes!
