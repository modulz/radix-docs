## Radius

The `radius` property controls the border radius applied to UI elements. Larger values illict a more playful feel, while lower values present as more formal and serious. It can be set either at the [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme) level, or directly on applicable components.

Unlike most other properties, `radius` is not a flat value derived from a scale, instead the rendered radius is contextual and differs depending on the component. For example, when set to `full`, a [Button](/themes/docs/components/button) becomes pill shaped while a [Card](/themes/docs/components/theme) will never exceed an appropriate curve.

Likewise, a [Checkbox](/themes/docs/components/checkbox) will never become fully rounded to prevent any visual confusion between it and a [Radio Group](/themes/docs/components/radio-group).

</Box>

### Instance overrides

You can override the radius of a component independently of the theme by passing `radius`.

This is helpful in cases where you'd like to apply a consistent radius across your UI but want to make specific exceptions, such as retaining circular avatars or pill shaped buttons.

```jsx live=true line=4
<Theme radius="small" style={{ maxWidth: 450 }}>
  <Card variant="surface" size="2">
    <Flex gap="3">
      <Avatar
        size="3"
        src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544005313-94ddf0286df2?&w=64&h=64&dpr=2&q=70&crop=faces&fit=crop"
        fallback="A"
        __radius__="full"
      />
      <Box grow="1">
        <TextArea placeholder="Replyâ€¦" style={{ height: 80 }} />
        <Flex gap="3" mt="3" justify="between">
          <Flex align="center" gap="2">
            <Checkbox checked />
            <Text size="2">Send to group</Text>
          </Flex>
          <Button>Send message</Button>
        </Flex>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  </Card>
</Theme>
```

### Shadow depth

Shadows are preconfigured in Radix Themes and provide visual depth. Values are defined internally and derived from a 6 step scale, with 1 being the lowest elevation (part of the lowest "surface") and 6 being highest (an overlayed dialog window).
