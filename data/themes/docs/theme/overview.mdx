# Theme overview

<Description>
  Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.
</Description>

## Anatomy

The [Theme component](/themes/docs/components/theme) defines the overall visual look of your application. It can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

```jsx live=true
<Theme
  accentColor="mint"
  grayColor="gray"
  panelBackground="solid"
  scaling="100%"
  radius="full"
>
  <ThemesVolumeControlExample />
</Theme>
```

A well tuned set of defaults is provided to get you started, but donâ€™t be afraid to play with all of the available options to find the right visual style for your application. Check out the [Playground](/themes/playground) to see what effect each option has.

{

  <Grid columns={{ initial: '1', xs: '2' }} my="6" gap="4">
      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Colors"
        desc="Pick your accent color and learn about the underlying token system."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/color#accents"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Appearance"
        desc="Set the color scheme of the theme, typically referred to as light and dark mode."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Typography"
        desc="Learn how to use and customize the typographic components in your theme."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/typography"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Layout"
        desc="How to use the layout components, common spacing props, and set the theme scaling."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/layout"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Radius"
        desc="Choose the radius setting in your theme that fits your brand."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/radius"
      />

      <ThemesLinkCard
        title="Custom components"
        desc="Learn to build your own components that use the same theme settings."
        href="/themes/docs/theme/custom-components"
      />
    </Grid>

}

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component which are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants, though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
  <Button variant="classic">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="solid">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="soft">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
</Flex>
```

Using a combination of component variants alongside customized theme settings allows you to create a multitude of unique-looking interfaces.
