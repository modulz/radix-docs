Oh, I see. You are not importing Radix Themes CSS, please follow the docs guide:
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/getting-started

It's not unstyled like the primitives, this is an opinionated component library with its own styles.

If you plan to continue using Radix Themes with Tailwind, make sure to check out this issue as the Tailwind reset overwrites our styles. We recommend to give it a go with plain CSS or CSS modules, as the value that Radix Themes provides and the value that Tailwind provides can get you into counterproductive situations.
