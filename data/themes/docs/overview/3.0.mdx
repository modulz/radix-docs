# Radix Themes 3.0

<Description>
  New layout engine, 11 new components, and brand color generator.
</Description>

## Introduction

Radix Themes 3.0 just landed. This release is big leap towards making Radix Themes the best component library for building modern SaaS apps.

## What is Radix Themes?

Radix Themes is an open source system of opinionated, pre-built components and design tokens that developers use to build React apps. Exceptional component API design and advanced visual design distinguish Radix Themes from other component libraries. It’s easy to get started, and just as easy to maintain a project built with Radix Themes.

Radix Themes is customised via [Theme](/themes/docs/theme/overview) configuration, underlying design tokens, and by building your own components on top of the same building blocks that the library itself is built upon. Naturally, WorkOS product UIs use Radix Themes, which makes it battle-tested in a demanding environment with thousands of users.

## New layout engine

This release brings a new layout engine to Radix Themes that makes layout components and their props more powerful and easier to use.

{

<Flex
  align="center"
  justify="center"
  height="300px"
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--gray-a2)' }}
>
  <Text size="2" color="gray">
    Layout engine image
  </Text>
</Flex>

}

Layout components are a cornerstone feature of Radix Themes. There’s just five of them—[Box](/themes/docs/components/box), [Flex](/themes/docs/components/flex), [Grid](/themes/docs/components/grid), [Section](/themes/docs/components/section), and [Container](/themes/docs/components/section). These components are used to separate layout responsibilities from content and interactivity. This is _the_ separation of concerns that makes apps maintainable and easy to reason about, and understanding these principles is key to building interfaces effectively.

In web development, the lines between different elements may be blurry. You can achieve similar results by layering different techniques onto the same building block, and end up with elements that try to do a lot of jobs at the same time, which incurs complexity, maintenance costs, and results in sneaky bugs.

In Radix Themes, every component is designed in such a way that it encourages you to use it just for what it can do really, really well. With that in mind, only layout components provide easy, unrestricted access to manipulate the layout of your interfaces. This is done through layout props, such as padding, width, height, or position, among others.

Layout components and their props are explained in the [Layout guide](/themes/docs/overview/layout).

### Better layout props

Layout components received a number of new layout props. On top of that, the way that layout props accept values has been significantly reworked:

- 9 new props for working with flex and grid layouts
- 4 new props for controlling the dimensions of layout components
- In addition to [space scale values](/themes/docs/theme/spacing), all layout props now accept valid CSS values, including when used with the responsive object syntax.

### Responsive object syntax

In Radix Themes, _responsive object syntax_ is how you build a responsive layout at different breakpoints without leaving the React code where you compose your app itself.

Consider the following piece of code:

```jsx
<Flex width="500px" />
```

This would create a flexbox layout that’s `500px` wide. But what if you wanted to use a different width on mobile? This is possible using the responsive object syntax, where you can specify the value to use at a particular breakpoint:

```jsx
<Flex width={{ initial: '100%', sm: '300px', md: '500px' }} />
```

Now, in addtion to [space scale values](/themes/docs/theme/spacing), layout props will support valid CSS values. For example, `100px`, `50vw`, or even expressions like `calc(100vw - 200px)` can be used at specific breakpoints.

However, does it perform well? Does it work with server components? Well, here’s how the above `<Flex>` element gets actually rendered into the DOM:

```jsx
<div
  style={{ '--width': '100%', '--width-md': '500px', '--width-sm': '300px'; }}
  class="rt-Flex rt-r-w sm:rt-r-w md:rt-r-w"
/>
```

You can see how that the `<Flex>` element was compiled into a combination of utility classes and CSS custom properties. There is no runtime evaluation of the breakpoints, which means the performance is just like vanilla CSS and the component can be rendered on the server.

### The best of both worlds

Altogether, there is 5 layout components with almost 40 props each. Together they form a system that is easy to learn, quick to master, and sets an _incredibly_ high ceiling of what you can achieve with them without leaving the safety of your JSX files.

If you have never used such a system, we’d suggest you give it try. It is a great alternative to Tailwind, which is an incredibly powerful tool originally built for the same purpose—layout. However, today that evolved into an entire styling paradigm that does not discourage you from creating complex styles on the fly, which violates the separation of concerns mentioned earlier.

Radix Themes layout comes with the full power that utility class frameworks may provide for layout, but it’s also type-safe and guides the developer in maintaining a clear boundary with the other pieces of the interface that they are building.

### Standalone layout components

If you want to use _just_ the layout component from Radix Themes, that’s also possible. Just make sure that JavaScript tree-shaking works on your side, and import the layout essentials CSS:

```jsx
import '@radix-ui/themes/layout.css';
```
