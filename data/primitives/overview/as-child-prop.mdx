# asChild

<Description>
  The `asChild` can be used to spread Radix functionality into your own
  components or DOM elements.
</Description>

All Radix primitive component parts that render a DOM element have an `asChild` prop. This is useful when you want a part to attach its accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element rather than create it's own.

## Passing a DOM element

If you decide to change the underlying node rendered by Radix (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it is up to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';

export default () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root>
      <Dialog.Trigger asChild>
        <div>Open dialog</div>
      </Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
};
```

## Passing a React component

If you pass a React component as child, then you will need to use [React.forwardRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) and spread the props onto a DOM element within your component.

Here's an example of how you can use a custom button called `MyButton` as the trigger for a `Dialog.Trigger`:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';

const MyButton = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => (
  <button {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />
));

export default () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root>
      <Dialog.Trigger __asChild__>
        <MyButton>Open dialog</MyButton>
      </Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>...</Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
};
```

## Summary

Using the `asChild` prop gives you more flexibility but requires you to take on more responsibility. If you're unsure, then we recommend using the default behaviour of Radix components.
