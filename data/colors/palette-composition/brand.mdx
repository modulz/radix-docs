## Choosing a gray scale

For most websites and apps, grays are commonly used for text, borders, and backgrounds.

Radix Colors provides 6 gray scales.

<ColorGrays />

- `Gray` is pure gray.
- `Mauve` is based on a desaturated purple hue.
- `Slate` is based on a desaturated blue hue.
- `Sage` is based on a desaturated green hue.
- `Olive` is based on a desaturated lime hue.
- `Sand` is based on a desaturated yellow hue.

### Neutral pairing

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `Gray` will work well with any hue or palette.

### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonius vibe.

## Choosing semantic scales

Each step in Radix Colors scales is designed for a specific use case. To help your team know which step to use, you can provide aliases based on the designed use cases.

## Choosing text scales

When designing for both light and dark modes, you sometimes need to map a variable to one color in light mode, and another color in dark mode. Common examples include:

- Components that have a white background in light mode and a subtle gray background in dark mode. For example, Card, Popover, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Dialog etc.
- Components that have a transparent black background in light mode and a transparent white background in dark mode. For example, Tooltip.
- Shadows that are saturated, transparent gray in light mode, and pure black in dark mode.
- An overlay that is light transparent black in light mode, and a darker transparent black in dark mode.

Avoid using specific variable names like "CardBg", or "Tooltip", because you will likely need to use each variable for multiple use cases.
