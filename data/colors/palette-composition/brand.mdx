# Choosing a brand color

<Description>
  A guide to providing semantic aliases for colors.
</Description>

## Choosing a brand scale

You can rename scales at import using `as`. Reasons might include:

- Rename a saturated gray to "gray" to keep things simple.
- Rename "sky" or "grass" to "blue" or "green" to keep things standard.
- Rename a scale to match your brand, like how Discord use "Blurple".
- Just to have some fun :)

```jsx
import {
  slate as gray,
  sky as blue,
  grass as green,
  violet as blurple,
  crimson as caribbeanSunset,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
```

## Choosing a gray scale

For most websites and apps, gray will be the most commonly used color. Text, borders, backgrounds.

Radix Colors offers 6 gray hues.

List the grays.

- The `gray` scale is pure gray.
- The `mauve` scale is based on a desaturated violet/purple hue.
- The `slate` scale is based on a desaturated blue hue.
- The `sage` scale is based on a desaturated green/teal.
- The `olive` scale is based on a desaturated green/lime.
- The `sand` scale is based on a desaturated yellow hue.

Explain how you can choose a gray to complement your accent color.

```jsx
import {
  slate as gray,
  slateDark as grayDark,
  blue,
  blueDark,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';

const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...gray,
      ...blue,
    },
  },
});

const darkTheme = theme({
  colors: {
    ...grayDark,
    ...blueDark,
  },
});
```

## Choosing semantic scales

Each step in Radix Colors scales is designed for a specific use case. To help your team know which step to use, you can provide aliases based on the designed use cases.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      accentBase: '$blue0',
      accentBgSubtle: '$blue1',
      accentBg: '$blue2',
      accentBgHover: '$blue3',
      accentBgActive: '$blue4',
      accentLine: '$blue5',
      accentBorder: '$blue6',
      accentBorderHover: '$blue7',
      accentSolid: '$blue8',
      accentSolidHover: '$blue9',
      accentText: '$blue10',
      accentTextContrast: '$blue11',

      successBase: '$green0',
      successBgSubtle: '$green1',
      // repeat for all steps

      warningBase: '$yellow0',
      warningBgSubtle: '$yellow1',
      // repeat for all steps

      dangerBase: '$red0',
      dangerBgSubtle: '$red1',
      // repeat for all steps
    },
  },
});
```

## Choosing text scales

When designing for both light and dark modes, you sometimes need to map a variable to one color in light mode, and another color in dark mode. Common examples include:

- Components that have a white background in light mode and a subtle gray background in dark mode. For example, Card, Popover, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Dialog etc.
- Components that have a transparent black background in light mode and a transparent white background in dark mode. For example, Tooltip.
- Shadows that are saturated, transparent gray in light mode, and pure black in dark mode.
- An overlay that is light transparent black in light mode, and a darker transparent black in dark mode.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...slate,
      ...slateA,
      ...whiteA,
      ...blackA,

      panel: 'white',
      panelContrast: '$blackA11',
      shadow: '$slateA3',
      overlay: '$blackA3',
    },
  },
});

const darkTheme = theme({
  colors: {
    ...slateDark,
    ...slateDarkA,
    ...whiteA,
    ...blackA,

    // Remap your colors for dark mode
    panel: '$slate2',
    panelContrast: '$whiteA11',
    shadow: 'black',
    overlay: '$blackA6',
  },
});
```

Avoid using specific variable names like "CardBg", or "Tooltip", because you will likely need to use each variable for multiple use cases.
