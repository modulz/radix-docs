## Use Cases

There are 11 steps in each scale. Each step was designed for at least one specific use case.

## Steps 1–2: Backgrounds

<ColorScale01 />

Radix Colors provides 26 scales, each with both light and dark variations. Import just the scales you need.

## Steps 3–5: Component backgrounds

<ColorScale02 />

Steps `3`, `4`, and `5` are designed for UI component backgrounds.

- Step `3` is for normal states.
- Step `4` is for hover states.
- Step `5` is for pressed or selected states.

<Note>
  Steps `11` and `12`—which are designed for text—are guaranteed to
  pass 4.5:1 contrast ratio on top of a step `3` background from the
  same scale.

## Steps 6–8: Borders

<ColorScale03 />

Step `6` is designed for subtle lines and borders on components which are not interactive.

- Sidebar borders
- Header borders
- Card borders
- Alert borders

Step `7` is designed for borders on interactive components.

- Button borders
- Text input borders
- Card borders

Step `8` is designed for borders on interactive components in their hover state.

## Steps 9–10: Solid backgrounds

<ColorScale04 />

Step `9` has the highest chroma of all steps in the scale. In other words, it's the purest step, the step mixed with the least amount of white or black. Because `9` is the purest step, it has a wide range of applications:

- Website/App backgrounds
- Website section backgrounds
- Header backgrounds
- Component backgrounds
- Graphics/Logos
- Overlays
- Coloured shadows
- Accent borders

Step `10` is designed for component hover states, where step `9` is the component's normal state background.
