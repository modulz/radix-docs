## Import scales

Radix Colors provides 26 scales, each with both light and dark variations. Import only the scales you need.

```jsx
import {
  gray,
  mauve,
  slate,
  sage,
  olive,
  sand,
  tomato,
  red,
  crimson,
  pink,
  plum,
  purple,
  violet,
  indigo,
  blue,
  sky,
  mint,
  cyan,
  teal,
  green,
  grass,
  lime,
  yellow,
  amber,
  orange,
  brown,
  bronze,
  gold,

  // All scales have a Dark variant for dark mode.
  grayDark,
  redDark,
  blueDark,
  greenDark,
  yellowDark,

  // All scales have an A variant for alpha transparency in light mode.
  grayA,
  redA,
  blueA,
  greenA,
  yellowA,

  // All scales have a DarkA variant for alpha transparency in dark mode.
  grayDarkA,
  redDarkA,
  blueDarkA,
  greenDarkA,
  yellowDarkA,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
```

## Define color themes

Once you've imported your scales, spread them in your themes.

```jsx
import { createCss } from '@stitches/react';

const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...gray,
      ...red,
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
    },
  },
});

const darkTheme = theme({
  colors: {
    ...grayDark,
    ...redDark,
    ...blueDark,
    ...greenDark,
    ...yellowDark,
  },
});
```

## Use a color in your styles

Each scale has 12 steps, from lowest to highest contrast. The variables will be the scale name suffixed with `0` through `11`.

```jsx
const Button = styled('button', {
  backgroundColor: '$blue2',
  color: '$blue9',
  borderColor: '$blue6',
  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: '$blue3',
    borderColor: '$blue7',
  },
});
```
