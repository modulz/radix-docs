# Aliasing

<Description>
  A guide to providing semantic aliases for colors.
</Description>

## Renaming imports

You can rename scales at import using `as`. Reasons might include:

- Rename a saturated gray to "gray" to keep things simple.
- Rename "sky" or "grass" to "blue" or "green" to keep things standard.
- Rename a scale to match your brand, like how Discord use "Blurple".
- Just to have some fun :)

```jsx
import {
  slate as gray,
  sky as blue,
  grass as green,
  violet as blurple,
  crimson as caribbeanSunset,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
```

## Semantic aliases

Maybe you want to rename to a scale to fit your brand. Maybe you want

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      accent0: '$blue0',
      accent1: '$blue1',
      accent2: '$blue2',
      accent3: '$blue3',
      accent4: '$blue4',
      accent5: '$blue5',
      accent6: '$blue6',
      accent7: '$blue7',
      accent8: '$blue8',
      accent9: '$blue9',
      accent10: '$blue10',
      accent11: '$blue11',

      success0: '$green0',
      success1: '$green1',
      // repeat for all steps

      warning0: '$yellow0',
      warning1: '$yellow1',
      // repeat for all steps

      danger0: '$red0',
      danger1: '$red1',
      // repeat for all steps
    },
  },
});
```

With this approach, you will likely run into issues where you need to use the same scale for multiple semantics. Common examples include:

- If you map `yellow` to "warning", you might also need `yellow` to communicate "pending".
- If you map `red` to "danger", you might also need `red` to communicate "error" or "rejected".
- If you map `green` to "success", you might also need `green` to communicate "valid".
- If you map `blue` to "accent", you might also need `blue` to communicate "info".

In this scenario, you can choose to define multiple semantic aliases which map to the same scale.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,

      accent0: '$blue0',
      accent1: '$blue1',
      info0: '$blue0',
      info1: '$blue1',

      success0: '$green0',
      success1: '$green1',
      valid0: '$green0',
      valid1: '$green1',

      warning0: '$yellow0',
      warning1: '$yellow1',
      pending0: '$yellow0',
      pending1: '$yellow1',
    },
  },
});
```

Or you can simply recommend that your teammates defer to the original scale name for situations where there is no appropriate semantic alias.

## Use case aliases

Each step in Radix Colors scales is designed for a specific use case. To help your team know which step to use, you can provide aliases based on the designed use cases.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      accentBase: '$blue0',
      accentBgSubtle: '$blue1',
      accentBg: '$blue2',
      accentBgHover: '$blue3',
      accentBgActive: '$blue4',
      accentLine: '$blue5',
      accentBorder: '$blue6',
      accentBorderHover: '$blue7',
      accentSolid: '$blue8',
      accentSolidHover: '$blue9',
      accentText: '$blue10',
      accentTextContrast: '$blue11',

      successBase: '$green0',
      successBgSubtle: '$green1',
      // repeat for all steps

      warningBase: '$yellow0',
      warningBgSubtle: '$yellow1',
      // repeat for all steps

      dangerBase: '$red0',
      dangerBgSubtle: '$red1',
      // repeat for all steps
    },
  },
});
```

Again, with this approach, you will likely run into issues where you need to use the same step for multiple use cases. Common examples include:

- Step 8 is designed for solid backgrounds, but it also works well for input placeholder text.
- Step 7 is designed for hovered component borders, but it also works well for focus rings.

In these cases, you can choose to define multiple aliases which map to the same step.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...gray,
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      graySolid: '$gray8',
      grayPlaceholderText: '$gray8',

      accentBorderHover: '$blue7',
      accentFocusRing: '$blue7',
    },
  },
});
```

Or you can simply recommend that your teammates defer to the original step number for situations where use cases don't have an alias.

## Mutable aliases

When designing for both light and dark modes, you sometimes need to map a variable to one color in light mode, and another color in dark mode. Common examples include:

- Components that have a white background in light mode and a subtle gray background in dark mode. For example, Card, Popover, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Dialog etc.
- Components that have a transparent black background in light mode and a transparent white background in dark mode. For example, Tooltip.
- Shadows that are saturated, transparent gray in light mode, and pure black in dark mode.
- An overlay that is light transparent black in light mode, and a darker transparent black in dark mode.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...slate,
      ...slateA,
      ...whiteA,
      ...blackA,

      panel: 'white',
      panelContrast: '$blackA11',
      shadow: '$slateA3',
      overlay: '$blackA3',
    },
  },
});

const darkTheme = theme({
  colors: {
    ...slateDark,
    ...slateDarkA,
    ...whiteA,
    ...blackA,

    // Remap your colors for dark mode
    panel: '$slate2',
    panelContrast: '$whiteA11',
    shadow: 'black',
    overlay: '$blackA6',
  },
});
```

Avoid using specific variable names like "CardBg", or "Tooltip", because you will likely need to use each variable for multiple use cases.
