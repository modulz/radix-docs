# Aliasing

<Description>Aliasing colors .</Description>

## Renaming imports

Maybe you want to rename to a scale to fit your brand. Maybe you want

```jsx
import {
  slate as gray,
  grass as green,
  sky as blue,
  orange as sunset,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
```

## Semantic aliases

Maybe you want to rename to a scale to fit your brand. Maybe you want

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      accent0: '$blue0',
      accent1: '$blue1',
      accent2: '$blue2',
      accent3: '$blue3',
      accent4: '$blue4',
      accent5: '$blue5',
      accent6: '$blue6',
      accent7: '$blue7',
      accent8: '$blue8',
      accent9: '$blue9',
      accent10: '$blue10',
      accent11: '$blue11',

      success0: '$green0',
      success1: '$green1',
      // repeat for all steps

      warning0: '$yellow0',
      warning1: '$yellow1',
      // repeat for all steps

      danger0: '$red0',
      danger1: '$red1',
      // repeat for all steps
    },
  },
});
```

## Use case aliases

Maybe you want to rename to a scale to fit your brand. Maybe you want

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...blue,
      ...green,
      ...yellow,
      ...red,

      accentBase: '$blue0',
      accentBgSubtle: '$blue1',
      accentBg: '$blue2',
      accentBgHover: '$blue3',
      accentBgActive: '$blue4',
      accentLine: '$blue5',
      accentBorder: '$blue6',
      accentBorderHover: '$blue7',
      accentSolid: '$blue8',
      accentSolidHover: '$blue9',
      accentText: '$blue10',
      accentTextContrast: '$blue11',
      accent12: '$blue12',

      successBase: '$green0',
      successBgSubtle: '$green1',
      // repeat for all steps

      warningBase: '$yellow0',
      warningBgSubtle: '$yellow1',
      // repeat for all steps

      dangerBase: '$red0',
      dangerBgSubtle: '$red1',
      // repeat for all steps
    },
  },
});
```

## Mutable aliases

When designing for both light and dark modes, you sometimes need to map a variable to one color in light mode, and another color in dark mode. Common examples include:

- Components that have a white background in light mode and a subtle gray background in dark mode. For example, Card, Popover, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Dialog etc.
- Components that have a transparent black background in light mode and a transparent white background in dark mode. For example, Tooltip.
- Shadows that are saturated, transparent gray in light mode, and pure black in dark mode.
- An overlay that is light transparent black in light mode, and a darker transparent black in dark mode.

```jsx
const { styled, theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...slate,
      ...slateA,
      ...whiteA,
      ...blackA,

      panel: 'white',
      panelContrast: '$blackA11',
      shadow: '$slateA3',
      overlay: '$blackA3',
    },
  },
});

const darkTheme = theme({
  colors: {
    ...slateDark,
    ...slateDarkA,
    ...whiteA,
    ...blackA,

    // Remap your colors for dark mode
    panel: '$slate2',
    panelContrast: '$whiteA11',
    shadow: 'black',
    overlay: '$blackA6',
  },
});
```

Avoid using specific variable names like "CardBg", or "Tooltip", because you will likely need to use each variable for multiple use cases.
