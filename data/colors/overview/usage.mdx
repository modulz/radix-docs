<Description>How to use Radix Colors.</Description>

Radix Colors is available as an npm package.

## Import scales

Radix Colors provides 26 scales, each with both light and dark variations. Import just the scales you need.

```jsx
import {
  blue,
  green,
  yellow,
  red,
  blueDark,
  greenDark,
  yellowDark,
  redDark,
} from '@radix-ui/colors';
```

## Add scales to your theme

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, run:

```jsx
import { createCss } from '@stitches/react';

export const lightMode { theme } = createCss({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      blue,
      green,
      yellow,
      red,
    },
  },
});

export const darkMode = theme({
  colors: {
    blueDark,
    greenDark,
    yellowDark,
    redDark,
  },
});
```

## Use a color in your styles

To install and save in your package.json dependencies, run:

```jsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';

const Button = styled('button', {
  backgroundColor: '$blue200',
  color: '$blue900',
});
```
