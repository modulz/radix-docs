description: An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox,
combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are [documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're
either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom components; an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important
features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded, open-source component library that the community can
use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Building accessible components is a highly demanding task. There are many things to take into consideration, from screen reader support to keyboard navigation.

We ensure that all components adhere to the [WAI-ARA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) when possible. Giving you a piece of mind and allowing you to focus on the UI.

Learn more in the [accessibility](./accessibility) page.

### Unstyled

All components ship without any CSS, giving you have full control over its look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, such as Stitches, or with CSS preprocessors such as Sass.

Learn more in the [styling](./styling) page.

### Opened

The Radix Primitives components were designed to be customized to suit your needs.

You have access to every part a component depends on. For example, when building a [Tooltip](../components/tooltip), you can access the `Trigger`, `Content` and `Arrow` parts. Having access to all the granular parts of a component gives you a large amount of flexibility to wrap them, add your own event listeners, add your own props or your own refs.

Some components also accept configurational props. For example, you can choose whether the [Popover](../components/popover) appears below or above its trigger.

### Uncontrolled

When applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can optionally be controlled if needed. All the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible.

For example, implementing a fully functioning [Dialog](../components/dialog) component doesn't require you to create any local states and update accordingly.

### Pleasant

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consitent and predictable experience.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions will update. Truly polymorphic.

### Incremental

Each primitive can be installed indivudually so you can incrementally adopt them over time.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-tooltip
```

Please refer to each primitive's documentation for installation instructions.
