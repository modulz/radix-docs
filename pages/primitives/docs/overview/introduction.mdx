Radix Primitives is a low-level component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience.

You can use these components as the base layer of your design system or just as a one off solution.

With Radix Primitives, you'll be able to implement complex UI Components in minutes, such as a [custom select](https://modulz.app/blog/under-the-spotlight-select).

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox,
combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are [documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're
either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom componentsâ€”an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important
features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded, open-source component library that the community can
use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Building accessible components is a highly demanding task. There are many things to take into consideration, from screen reader support to keyboard navigation.

We ensure that all components adhere to the [WAI-ARA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) when possible. Giving you a piece of mind and allowing you to focus on the UI.

Learn more in the [accessibility](./accessibility) page.

### Unstyled

All components ship without any CSS, giving you have full control over its look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, such as Stitches, or with CSS preprocessors such as Sass.

Learn more in the [styling](./styling) page.

### Opened

The Radix Primitives components were designed to be customized to suit your needs.

You have access to every part a component depends on. For example, when building a [Tooltip](../components/tooltip), you can access the `Trigger`, `Content` and `Arrow` parts. Having access to all the granular parts of a component gives you a large amount of flexibility to wrap them, add your own event listeners, add your own props or your own refs.

Some components also accept configurational props. For example, you can choose whether the [Popover](../components/popover) appears below or above its trigger.

### Uncontrolled

When applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can optionally be controlled if needed. All the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible.

For example, implementing a fully functioning [Dialog](../components/dialog) component doesn't require you to create any local states and update accordingly.

### Pleasant

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consitent and predictable experience.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions will update. Truly polymorphic.

### Incremental

Each primitive can be installed indivudually so you can incrementally adopt them over time.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-tooltip
```

Please refer to each primitive's documentation for installation instructions.

## A quick tutorial

Let's take a few minutes to install, style, and create a Popover Component, powered by the [Popover Primitive](../components/popover).

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover
```

### 2. Expose

Import and export the parts. Add styles where desired.

**Note:** This example uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) but any styling solution is [compatible](./styling).

```jsx
// Popover.tsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
export const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {...});
```

### 3. Use it

```jsx
// App.tsx
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
} from 'your-components/Popover';

function App() {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <PopoverTrigger>...</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>...</PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

### Demo

```jsx live manual compact
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {
  backgroundColor: 'white',
  borderRadius: 6,
  boxShadow: '0px 10px 38px -10px hsla(206,22%,7%,.35)',
  overflow: 'hidden',

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

// Other components in your App
const Box = styled('div', {});
const Text = styled('div', {
  fontSize: 16,
});
const Button = styled('button', {
  appearance: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',
  border: '1px solid hsl(272,68%,70%)',
  color: 'hsl(272,62%,44%)',
  padding: '5px 15px',
  borderRadius: 4,

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

export default () => (
  <Popover>
    <PopoverTrigger as={Button}>Trigger</PopoverTrigger>
    <PopoverContent sideOffset={3}>
      <Box css={{ width: 320 }}>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596420667316-cb2b4f67fc6d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2250&q=80" />
        <Box css={{ padding: 20 }}>
          <Text css={{ fontWeight: 500 }}>Brian Lundquist</Text>
          <Text
            css={{
              margin: '5px 0 15px',
              color: 'slategray',
              fontSize: 14,
            }}
          >
            @bwl667
          </Text>
          <Button css={{ width: '100%' }}>Download</Button>
        </Box>
      </Box>
    </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
);
```

### Conclusion

The steps above are generally what it takes to use a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough giving you control to choose how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit your team's and product's needs.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customise side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
