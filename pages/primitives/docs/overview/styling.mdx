Radix Primitives are unstyled, giving you have full control over its look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, with CSS preprocessors and even vanilla CSS.

Regardless of your preferred styling solution, this page will cover how to style them.

---

### Overview

#### Functional styles

You're in charge of every single style that gets applies. This also includes functional styles. For example, by default a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't be covering the entire viewport.

#### Data attributes

All components have a `data-radix-*` attribute, matching its name. For example, the [Separator](../components/separator) component will include the `data-radix-separator` attribute.

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/dialog) is opened, it'll include the `data-state="open"` attribute.

#### Classes

All components accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### CSS

#### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targering its `data-radix-*` attribute.

```css
[data-radix-accordion-item] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

[data-radix-accordion-panel] {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

#### Styling a state

You can target the `data-state` attribute to style states.

```css
[data-radix-accordion-item] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

[data-radix-accordion-item][data-state='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

### CSS-in-JS

#### Styling a part

You can style a component part by wrapping it in a `styled` function (or similar).

The examples below are using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but you an use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
});

const StyledPanel = styled(Accordion.Panel, {
  padding: 10,
});
```

#### Styling a state

You can target the `data-state` attribute to style states.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',

  '&[data-state=open]': {
    borderBottomWidth: '2px',
  },
});
```

#### Demo

Here's an example of how you can style the [Accordion](../components/accordion) component with CSS-in-JS.

```jsx live manual compact
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const Accordion = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Root, {
  borderTop: '1px solid hsl(272,68%,70%)',
});

const Item = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid hsl(272,68%,70%)',
});

const Header = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Header, {
  margin: 0,
  display: 'flex',
});

const Button = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Button, {
  appearance: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',
  color: 'hsl(272,62%,44%)',
  padding: '10px 15px',
  flex: 1,
  textAlign: 'left',

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow:
      '0 0 0 1px hsl(272,62%,44%), 0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

const Panel = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Panel, {
  padding: '10px 15px',
  color: 'hsl(272,62%,44%)',
});

export default () => (
  <Accordion>
    <Item value="item-1">
      <Header>
        <Button>Item 1</Button>
      </Header>
      <Panel>Here goes the content for the accordion item 1.</Panel>
    </Item>

    <Item value="item-2">
      <Header>
        <Button>Item 2</Button>
      </Header>
      <Panel>Here goes the content for the accordion item 2.</Panel>
    </Item>

    <Item value="item-3">
      <Header>
        <Button>Item 3</Button>
      </Header>
      <Panel>Here goes the content for the accordion item 3.</Panel>
    </Item>
  </Accordion>
);
```

### Conclusion

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring consumers have full control over the look and feel.

To ensure compatibility with global CSS solutions, components include a `data-radix-*` attribute. Stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.

Every component that renders an HTML element will contain these attributes, so feel free to inspect them and look around.
