Radix Primitives are unstyled, giving you have full control over its look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, with CSS preprocessors and even vanilla CSS.

Regardless of your preferred styling solution, this page will cover how to style them.

### Overview

#### Functional styles

You're in charge of every single style that gets applies. This also includes functional styles. For example, by default a [Dialog Overlay]() won't be covering the entire viewport.

#### Data attributes

All components have a `data-radix-*` attribute, matching its name. For example, the [Separator]() component will include the `data-radix-separator` attribute.

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item]() is opened, it'll include the `data-state="open"` attribute.

#### Classes

All components accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### CSS

#### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targering its `data-radix-*` attribute.

```css
[data-radix-accordion-item] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

[data-radix-accordion-panel] {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

#### Styling a state

You can target the `data-state` attribute to style states.

```css
[data-radix-accordion-item] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

[data-radix-accordion-item][data-state='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

### CSS-in-JS

#### Styling a part

You can style a component part by wrapping it in a `styled` functions (or similar).

```jsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const Item = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
});

const Panel = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Panel, {
  padding: 10,
});
```

#### Styling a state

You can target the `data-state` attribute to style states.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const Item = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',

  '&[data-state=open]': {
    borderBottomWidth: '2px',
  },
});
```
