Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.

## Vision

Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox,
combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are [documented by WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're
either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom components; an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important
features.

Our goal is to create a well-funded, open-source component library that the community can
use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) where possible. We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Learn more in our [accessibility](./accessibility) overview.

### Unstyled

Components ship with zero styles, giving you complete control over styling. Components are compatible with CSS-in-JS libraries, CSS preprocessors, and vanilla CSS. Learn more in our [styling](./styling) guide.

### Opened

Radix Primitives are designed to be customized to suit your needs. Our open component architecture provides you granular access to each component part, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Uncontrolled

Where applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can also be controlled, alternatively. All of the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible, without needing to create any local states.

### Developer experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consitent and predictable experience. We've also implemented a truly polymorphic `as` prop, so the prop suggestions update.

### Incremental adoption

Each primitive can be installed individually so you can adopt them incrementally.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

Primitives are also versioned independently, to further facilitate incremental adoption.

## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install, style, and export a [Popover](../components/popover) component. This example uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but any styling solution is compatible.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover
```

### 2. Style each part

Import and export the parts. Add styles where desired.

```jsx
// Popover.tsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
export const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {
  backgroundColor: 'white',
  borderRadius: 6,
  boxShadow: '0px 10px 38px -10px hsla(206,22%,7%,.35)',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});
```

### 3. Use it

Import each of the component parts into your app, then assemble your Popover.

```jsx
// App.tsx
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
} from 'your-components/Popover';

function App() {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <PopoverTrigger>...</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>...</PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

### Demo

```jsx live manual compact primitives
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {
  backgroundColor: 'white',
  borderRadius: 6,
  boxShadow: '0px 10px 38px -10px hsla(206,22%,7%,.35)',
  overflow: 'hidden',

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

// Other components in your App
const Box = styled('div', {});
const Text = styled('div', {
  fontSize: 16,
});
const Button = styled('button', {
  appearance: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',
  border: '1px solid hsl(272,68%,70%)',
  color: 'hsl(272,62%,44%)',
  padding: '5px 15px',
  borderRadius: 4,

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

export default () => (
  <Popover>
    <PopoverTrigger>Trigger</PopoverTrigger>
    <PopoverContent sideOffset={3}>
      <Box css={{ width: 320 }}>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596420667316-cb2b4f67fc6d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2250&q=80" />
        <Box css={{ padding: 20 }}>
          <Text css={{ fontWeight: 500 }}>Brian Lundquist</Text>
          <Text
            css={{
              margin: '5px 0 15px',
              color: 'slategray',
              fontSize: 14,
            }}
          >
            @bwl667
          </Text>
          <Button css={{ width: '100%' }}>Download</Button>
        </Box>
      </Box>
    </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
);
```

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customise side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
